Hi. My name is Jesse. I'm a co-founder and the CTO of [Ratio PBC](https://ratiopbc.com), a public
benefit corporation at the intersection of public health, government & commercial health care.

Previously I founded [Watsi](https://watsi.org/monthly), [Y Combinator's](https://web.archive.org/web/20180926115242/http://old.ycombinator.com/watsi.html)
first non-profit. I'm also a contributor to several open source projects,
most notably [Rubinius](http://rubini.us) and [MagLev](http://maglev.github.io),
but that feels like a lifetime ago. I've focused on Elixir and its ecosystem since 2017, bringing it to
interesting places like [basic income](https://www.openresearchlab.org/basic-income) and
the COVID-19 pandemic response (links soon).

Hi. My name is Jesse. At the moment I'm a digital nomad, on the path to the next thing.

I'm a co-founder of [Watsi](https://watsi.org/monthly), [Y Combinator's](http://ycombinator.com/watsi.html) first non-profit.
I'm also a contributor to several open source projects, most notably [Rubinius](http://rubini.us) and [MagLev](http://maglev.github.io).

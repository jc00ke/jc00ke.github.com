A few days ago my friend [Randall](https://twitter.com/daksis) asked me for
some tiered recommendations for laptops that run Linux well. Here's what I came
up with:

Note: They're all 13" laptops.

## Under $1000 USD

### Samsung Book 9 Lite [link](http://j.mp/1vKtjYI)

I'm a big fan of Samsung laptops, in fact I'm writing this on a 15" New Series 9
that's actually in a 14" body. Thin, sleek... these laptops look really good.
For $799 ($360 discount at the moment) this quad-core AMD machine comes with 4GB
of RAM which is a good starting point for most developers.

I'd definitely consider this an entry level laptop, but one that's got good
specs for a good price.

## $1000 - $2000 USD

### Samsung Book 9 Plus [link](http://j.mp/1vKwuzP)

Top of my list is this 13" Samsung with an Intel i7. $1549.99 is a bit spendy,
but it's sleek, fast, and has 256GB of SSD goodness.

My hesitations with this laptop are based on difficulties I had with the 15" New
Series 9: difficult to get Linux installed and the case cracked.

On getting Ubuntu installed originally, there was some BIOS issue that prevented
the laptop from booting up to a USB drive. I had to return 2 laptops before I
got one that worked. After that, smooth sailing.

And... the case cracked. I think it's partly from the stress of opening and
closing the lid, and partly from a little heat that comes off of the charger.

It got so bad that I couldn't open up the lid without risking snapping the whole
lid off. I fashioned a metal plate and used J-B Kwik Weld to adhere the plate to
the lid but even that hasn't held all the way. I hope that Samsung addressed
this in later versions.

### Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Touch [link](http://j.mp/1vKAmkc)

My mom bought one of these from [Adron](https://twitter.com/adron) and it was
already running Ubuntu. I switched her over to Xubuntu (more on that later)
and it runs really well. ThinkPads have a reputation running Linux, and that
doesn't seem to have been lost when Lenovo acquired IBM's hardware line.

If I decide against another Samsung I'll be grabbing one of these.

### Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition [link](http://j.mp/1vKAOPt)

For $1199 this laptop is pretty sweet too, mostly because it comes with Ubuntu
12.04 LTS pre-installed. Hopefully Dell will bump the version soon! I'm done
with Dells, but for those out there that aren't, this is a great model.

## Over $2000 USD

Sorry, don't have a rec for a laptop over $2000. I suppose some really souped-up
13" or 15" would get you over, or some gaming rig, but I think that's probably
too much for most developers. If it's not, then either a MacBook Pro or
[ThinkPad W540](http://j.mp/1vKC5Gg) with the i7-4930 for an extra $930 should
do the trick. Of course I'd be getting it with 32GB RAM, because why not?

## Flavor

As for flavor of Linux, I've been using Ubuntu or a variant since 2007 and I highly recommend it. Over Xmas I switched from Ubuntu to Xubuntu, which uses Xfce instead of Gnome, and I really like it. Same kernel, same app compatibility and install through Aptitude and the Ubuntu Software Center, and it's lighter/faster than Ubuntu/Gnome.

## Wrap Up

There are a ton of choices, but the most solid ones are really fantastic. Maybe
Linux never took over the Desktop, and that's fine. It works well on laptops
and I appreciate the computer I have.

## UPDATE

I received a great email from [Jeff Bonhags](https://twitter.com/jeffbonhag)
regarding the Lenovo Yoga Pro 2. With this in mind, I'm removing the Yoga Pro 2
from my list. Here's Jeff's email:

> Hi Jesse,

> I was psyched to see your Linux laptop recommendations article, less so
to see the Yoga Pro 2 recommended.  I've been using Linux on that laptop
for about six months, and I don't think it's a great choice.

> The laptop has a few strikes against it to begin with: the touchpad is
_terrible_, the touchscreen/tablet mode is weird and/or pointless.  The
touchscreen is pressure sensitive (not heat sensitive), so if you
accidentally brush a piece of paper or a wire against the screen the
mouse cursor will jump all over the place.

> I tried out OpenSUSE, Fedora, Ubuntu, and Arch, and there were plenty of
weird quirks with all of them.  The Intel 7260 Bluetooth/wifi card is
new enough that it doesn't have stellar Linux support yet.  So you have
to fiddle with rfkill and blacklist the ideapad_laptop module.  Suspend
is far from perfect: on OpenSUSE 13.1 there were gross video artifacts
when I opened the laptop lid and could only (but not always) get rid of
them by switching to a virtual console and then back to X again --
although these went away when I upgraded to OpenSUSE Factory (which I'm
using now).  Sometimes the keys would stay activated in tablet mode,
sometimes they wouldn't.

> I'm sorry I don't have a better recommendation, or else I'd be using it!
Let me know if you hear anything from other readers.

> Also, sorry if this is coming off as rant-y -- tweaking a couple of
settings isn't the end of the world, but this laptop has been
surprisingly difficult to use with Linux.

> Regards,
> Jeff Bonhag

If there are any other experiences I'd love to hear about them.

I've been on a bit of a smoothie kick this year, and with the help of
[Superfood Smoothies](http://j.mp/superfood-smoothies) by Julie Morris I've made
some delicious concoctions.

Yesterday's is really, really tasty, so I thought I'd share.

* 1 cup So Delicious coconut milk, regular
* 6 - 8 pieces of ice
* 1 whole banana, unfrozen
* 2 tbsp [shelled hemp seeds](http://j.mp/1qBaXGW)
* 1 tsp [maca powder](http://j.mp/1wf2DwQ)
* 1 spoonful of [wheatgrass powder](http://j.mp/1qCpaTu)
* 2 spoonfuls of Seville Orange marmalade
* 1 spoonful of blackberry preserve
* 1 handful of whole walnuts
* half a bunch of raw, organic spinach

Crush and liquify/puree and give it a taste. Add more marmalade if the orange
isn't strong enough, which it should be.

I'll share my normal smoothie recipe another time, but I was really happy with
how this one turned out! Lots of vitamins, some fats, protein... a great way to
start the day.

ps: Thanks to [Kevin Lynagh](https://twitter.com/lynaghk) for the maca and the
inspiration to write down these recipes.

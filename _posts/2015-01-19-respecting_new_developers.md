I have been writing code professionally for 10 years now, and in that 10 years I
have forgotten what it's like to be a new developer.

There are a lot of things that have changed in those 10 years. The first half of
my career, 2004 to 2009, was in a different culture than where I am now:
Microsoft .NET-land. I dipped my toes into Ruby and the OSS community in 2008,
jumped in wholeheartedly in 2009, but by then I had years of experience. Not a
ton, but enough to where I felt comfortable in my skills.

Over the next 5 years, I worked with numerous clients, from start-ups to Fortune
500 behemoths. I was a co-founder at [Watsi](https://watsi.org) (go donate!) and
have contributed to [a lot](https://github.com/jc00ke?tab=activity) of OSS
projects in different ways. All the while, I've tried to help foster the next
group of new developers through code reviews, pairing sessions, Q&A at different
local events, etc. Needless to say, I've tried to help where I can, and believe
myself to be relatively good as a helper and mentor.

But back in November, I was reminded of what I don't know, and that even with
all my experience I still need to be constantly improving myself.

In November I experienced a failure as a mentor, one that I am happy to talk
about. Take a few minutes to read through the comments on [this
pull-request](https://github.com/calagator/calagator/pull/233) for Calagator.

Notice my *Ah ha* moment? It was real. I was not backpedaling, nor was I trying
to "save face" or "play nice." I had not spent the time to look at things from
Natalie's point of view. This oversight was my mistake, not hers. This oversight
meant that I caused the person I had intended to help to have a negative
experience and to feel unnecessary anxiety.

What I've been mulling over since then is the notion that "experts" need to not
just help educate, guide and foster, but *must respect* the path and nuances of
that path new developers wish to take. It's easy for the established developer
to say "Well, you should just do it this way," especially when it comes to code,
our domain of expertise. What we forget is that "this way" is really "my way".

It's their journey to take as they wish. There are many things to take into
account: health of the code base, history, practice, and best practices. But OSS
is not just about the text in a file, it's about the people. Understanding that
people have different backgrounds and motivations is key to successful
interactions.

I want to be a guide, not a conductor. But I've realized with this incident that
these things are very social, they can be emotional and they deserve patience
and thoughtfulness on my end. When I say emotional, I mean it. I inadvertently
caused someone to feel anxiety, which was not my intention! *I* must be careful
what and how I communicate. It's part of my responsibility to understand her
point-of-view, not just advocate for mine.

This pull-request was a learning experience for me in a social sense, just as
much as it was a learning experience for Natalie in a technical sense.

Consider these aspects in your next interaction with a new developer and see if
you learn something about yourself and how to be a better developer.

Speaking of Pat, he's been working very hard for the last 6 months to create
the best way to learn Ruby: [RubySteps](https://rubysteps.com/). If you are a
new developer, check it out. If you're not, check it out and recommend it to a
friend.

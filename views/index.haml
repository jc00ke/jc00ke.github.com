        Hello. My name is Jesse Cooke, and I'm an N-Tier Engineer.
    
        I hadn't heard that before, &quot;N-Tier Engineer&quot;, and I thought it was catchy.
        I consider an N-Tier engineer to be a person that can work effectively on the whole stack. Since I concentrate on
        web applications, this means I feel I'm pretty good at:

        * Front-end (HTML5, CSS3, the Javascripts/Coffeescript)
        * Back-end (Rails, Sinatra, etc)
        * Database (Relational &amp; Non-relational)

        Besides working on web apps, I do enjoy working on other types of software projects. Many of the projects I've considered to be the most fun are
        tools/utilities. As long as it's interesting I'm ready to work on it.

        If you have an interesting problem &amp; are looking for a creative and well-executed solution, shoot me an email or give me a call.

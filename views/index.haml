        Hello. My name is Jesse Cooke, and I'm an N-Tier Engineer.
    
        I hadn't heard that before, &quot;N-Tier Engineer&quot;, and I thought it was catchy.                               |
        I consider an N-Tier engineer to be a person that can work effectively on the whole stack. Since I concentrate on   |
        web applications, this means I feel I'm pretty good at:

        * Front-end, (HTML5, CSS3, the Javascripts)
        * Back-end (Rails, Sinatra, no more .NET)
        * Database (Relational &amp; Non-relational)

        Besides working on web apps, I do enjoy working on other types of software projects. Many of the projects I've considered to be the most fun are |
        tools/utilities. As long as it's interesting &amp; interesting I'm ready to work on it.

        So those are my interests. Right now I'm concentrating on Ruby &amp; the &quot;NoSQL&quot; or &quot;Post Relational&quot; databases.  |
        If you have an interesting problem &amp; are looking for a creative and well-executed solution, [shoot me an email or give me a call](/contact).
